# Bittensor Technical Assessment This repo contains code for the Bittensor Technical Assessment.

Objectives My objectives for this assessment are to: 1. create a dashboard that displays fiat prices
for 15 cryptocurrencies in real time - matching the design provided 2. style the dashboard to be
responsive 3. design the dashboard with accessibility in mind, so it is easily usable by
visually-impaired and/or keyboard users 4. integrate analytics 5. employ SEO best practices
(including server-side rendering) 6. do it all in 2 days of work (or less)! ## Technology Highlights

-   Svelte 5 (SvelteKit): extremely lightweight and performant (not requiring a browser runtime,
    unlike React or Vue) and a joy to use - Tailwind: allows for rapid prototyping and easy styling -
    Sass: allows for easy styling when Tailwind is not enough - GoatCounter: simple, privacy-focused
    analytics (https://ezra-bittensor-assessment.goatcounter.com/) - bun: very speedy package manager
    (though I will also include instructions for npm/yarn) - Highcharts: powerful, flexible, accessible
    charting library (using a Personal License obtained for this project) ## How to set up the repo 1.
